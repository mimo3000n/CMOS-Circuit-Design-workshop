## Overview

This workshop is designed to provide a deep understanding of CMOS design fundamentals through SPICE simulations. Over five days, participants will explore the behavior of NMOS and CMOS inverters in different operating regions, evaluate switching thresholds, noise margins, and analyze robustness against supply and device variations. Each session includes hands-on SPICE simulations backed by strong theoretical foundations, making it ideal for learners who wish to master transistor-level circuit behavior.

The global semiconductor resurgence – fueled by sovereign CHIPS initiatives, a surging demand for edge‑AI silicon, and an acute shortage of analog‑mixed‑signal talent – has made open, mature‑node platforms like SKY130 the fastest on‑ramp from idea to tape‑out. This ten‑day, cloud based online workshop positions you at the heart of that movement, translating industry‑grade CMOS theory into actionable design insight while leveraging the very PDK that start‑ups, national fabs, and university shuttle programs now rely on for first‑silicon success.

Across 10-days, you will dissect device physics, construct parameter‑swept SPICE decks, and benchmark inverter robustness under real‑world process and voltage variation. Each module pairs concise lectures with guided labs – covering velocity‑saturation, noise‑margin optimisation, dynamic power analysis, and script‑driven verification – so every concept is cemented by plots you generate yourself. Exclusive toolchains, reference designs, and daily design clinics ensure you leave with reusable IP blocks and a repeatable simulation workflow that dovetails directly into open‑source RTL‑to‑GDS flows such as OpenLane and VSDFlow.

Graduates emerge ready to contribute immediately to low‑power IoT nodes, automotive safety ICs, and chiplet‑based heterogenous packages – all markets leaning heavily on 130 nm for cost‑balanced innovation. Whether you aim to upskill a design team, strengthen research credentials, or fast‑track a prototype toward fabrication, this program delivers the simulation mastery and process‑aware mindset demanded by today’s accelerated semiconductor landscape.
